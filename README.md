## A demo Quiz Web Application

**“How do I make a JavaScript quiz?”** is one of the most common questions asked by people learning web development, so this repository might help those devs to get started by understanding the basic logic of a quiz web app. Quizzes are fun! They’re a great way of learning about new subjects, and they allow you to engage your audience with something fun and playful.

I have already commented out important things but don’t forget to play with the code and try something new :)
